    "# tracert\n",
    "The `tracert` (short for \"traceroute\") command on Windows is a network diagnostic tool that helps you trace the route that packets take to reach a destination IP address or domain. It provides information about the number of hops (intermediate devices or routers) between your computer and the destination, as well as the round-trip times for each hop. This can be useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding the path that data takes across the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can use the `tracert` command on Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Command Prompt**:\n",
    "   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.\n",
    "   - Type `cmd` and press Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type the Tracert Command**:\n",
    "   - In the Command Prompt window, type the following command:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     tracert [destination]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Replace `[destination]` with the IP address or domain name of the target you want to trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Press Enter**:\n",
    "   - Press Enter to execute the `tracert` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tracert` command will start sending packets to the destination, and you will see a list of hops along with round-trip times. Here's a brief explanation of the information provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hop Number**: Each line represents a hop in the route, starting from 1. The last line represents the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IP Address**: The IP address of the device at each hop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**: The time it takes for a packet to travel from your computer to the specified hop and back. This is measured in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a hop times out or shows an asterisk (*), it means that the device at that hop did not respond within the specified time limit. This could be due to various reasons, such as firewall settings or network congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the `tracert` command with various options. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `tracert -d [destination]` to avoid resolving IP addresses to hostnames.\n",
    "- Use `tracert -h [max_hops] [destination]` to set the maximum number of hops.\n",
    "- Use `tracert -w [timeout] [destination]` to set the timeout for each reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full list of options, you can type `tracert /?` in the Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the effectiveness of `tracert` can be limited by firewalls, routers, or other devices that may block or prioritize certain types of network traffic. Additionally, some devices may be configured not to respond to `tracert` requests for security reasons."
