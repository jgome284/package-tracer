# Network Adaptors
Also known as a Network Interface Controller (NIC), is a hardware device that allows a computer to connect to a network. It is responsible for sending and receiving data packets over the network. Network adapters can be wired or wireless. 
Network adapters are typically installed inside a computer. However, there are also external network adapters that can be connected to a computer using a USB port or other interface.

## Wired Network Adaptors
Wired network adapters connect to a network using a cable, such as an Ethernet cable. Ethernet adapters are the most common type of network adapter. They are used to connect computers to wired networks. Ethernet adapters are typically available in two speeds: 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps.

The Transmit and Receive pins on each connector will depend on the device type. For example, Routers transmit (Tx) data on pins 1 and 2 and receive (Rx) data on pins 3 and 6. The same goes for Firewalls and PCs. Switches on the other hand transmit (Tx) data on pins 3 and 6 and Receive data on pins 1 and 2.

### RJ-45 
RJ-45 is the 8 pin connector that is typically used on the end of an copper ethernet cable. The amount of pins used will depend on the Ethernet standard that is intended for use. For example, 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T will only typically use 4 pins on the 8 pin connector. Faster Ethernet standards will use all 8 pins.

### SFP Transceiver
Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) is the adaptor for a fiber optic cable. Fiber optic adapters are typically faster than Ethernet adapters, but they are also more expensive.

### Auto MDI-X 
Nowadays, MDI-X allows devices to automatically reconfigure where they send and receive data from. So practically it is not required to remember where network devices are preconfigured to send and receive data.

## Wireless Network Adaptors
Wireless network adapters connect to a network using radio waves. Wireless adapters are typically available in two frequencies: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

# Loopback Interfaces
- A loopback interface is a virtual interface in the router.
- It is always up/up (unless you manually shut it down)
- It is not dependent on a physical interface.
- It provides a consistent IP address that can be used to reach / identify the router.

# Ethernet

## Ethernet Standards

Ethernet standards are a set of specifications that define the physical and data link layer protocols for Ethernet networks. Ethernet is a wired networking technology that uses Ethernet cables to connect devices together. Ethernet is the most common type of wired networking technology, and it is used in a wide variety of environments, including homes, businesses, and schools.

The IEEE 802.3 standard is the primary Ethernet standard. The IEEE 802.3 standard defines a number of different Ethernet standards, including:

- 10BASE-T: 10 Mbps Ethernet using twisted-pair cable
- 100BASE-TX: 100 Mbps Ethernet using twisted-pair cable
- 100BASE-FX: 100 Mbps Ethernet using fiber optic cable
- 1000BASE-T: 1000 Mbps Ethernet using twisted-pair cable
- 1000BASE-SX: 1000 Mbps Ethernet using multimode fiber optic cable
- 1000BASE-LX: 1000 Mbps Ethernet using single-mode fiber optic cable
- 10GBASE-T: 10 Gbps Ethernet using twisted-pair cable
- 10GBASE-SR: 10 Gbps Ethernet using multimode fiber optic cable
- 10GBASE-LR: 10 Gbps Ethernet using single-mode fiber optic cable

Ethernet standards are constantly being updated to support higher speeds and longer distances. The latest Ethernet standard, IEEE 802.3ba, defines a new standard for 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps Ethernet using twisted-pair cable.

Ethernet standards are important because they ensure that Ethernet devices from different manufacturers can work together seamlessly. Ethernet standards also help to ensure that Ethernet networks are reliable and efficient.

## Ethernet Interface
An Ethernet interface is a network interface controller (NIC) that allows a computer or other device to connect to an Ethernet network. Ethernet is a wired networking standard that uses Ethernet cables to connect devices together. Ethernet is the most common type of wired networking technology, and it is used in a wide variety of environments, including homes, businesses, and schools.

Ethernet interfaces are typically built into computers and other devices, but they can also be purchased as external devices. External Ethernet interfaces are typically connected to a computer or other device using a USB port.

Ethernet interfaces support a variety of speeds, including 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps. The speed of an Ethernet interface is determined by the type of Ethernet cable that is used and the capabilities of the Ethernet interface.

Ethernet interfaces are an essential part of many modern networks. They allow devices to connect to each other and to access shared resources, such as files and printers.


# Use Cases
## Home networks
In home networks, NICs are typically used to connect computers to routers. This allows the computers to communicate with each other and to access the internet.

## Business networks
In business networks, NICs are typically used to connect computers to switches. This allows the computers to communicate with each other and to access shared resources, such as files and printers.

## Data centers
In data centers, NICs are used to connect servers to switches and routers. This allows the servers to communicate with each other and to access the internet.
