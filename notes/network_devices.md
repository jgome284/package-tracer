# Network Devices
## Routers
Network routers are devices that connect two or more networks together and forward data packets between them. They are used to create a wide area network (WAN), which is a group of networks that are connected to each other and can share resources, such as files and printers. NICs can be connected to routers to allow computers to communicate with devices on other networks. 

Routers work by examining the destination address of each data packet and forwarding it to the appropriate network. They can also be used to create different subnets within a network. A subnet is a group of devices that are connected to the same network and share the same IP address prefix.

Routers are typically used in wired networks, but they can also be used in wireless networks. In a wired network, routers are connected to each other using Ethernet cables. In a wireless network, routers are connected to wireless access points, which allow devices to connect to the network using radio waves. 

Routers typically have lower network interfaces than switches. Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs.

## Switches
Switches are networking devices that connect multiple devices to the same network. They are used to create a local area network (LAN), which is a group of devices that are connected to each other and can share resources, such as files and printers.

Switches work by forwarding data packets between the devices that are connected to them. When a device sends a data packet, the switch examines the destination address of the packet and forwards it to the appropriate port. The switch will also block any packets that are not intended for any of the devices that are connected to it.

Switches are typically used in wired networks, but they can also be used in wireless networks. In a wired network, switches are connected to each other using Ethernet cables. In a wireless network, switches are connected to wireless access points, which allow devices to connect to the network using radio waves.

Switches offer a number of advantages over other networking devices, such as hubs:
> **Performance:** Switches are more efficient than hubs because they forward data packets directly to the destination device. This can improve the performance of the network, especially under heavy load.

> **Security:** Switches can be used to improve the security of a network by blocking unauthorized access to the network. For example, a switch can be configured to allow only certain devices to access the network.

> **Scalability:** Switches can be scaled to support a large number of devices. This makes them ideal for use in large networks, such as business networks and data centers.

## Firewall
Typically this function is implemented via software as a 'Host-based firewall', but a firewall can also be implemented via hardware and known as a 'Network Firewall'. Often it is included as a physical device in large datacenters. 

Firewalls can be added 'outside' to filter traffic before it hits a router or 'inside' after it passes the router in a network. They are configured to monitor and control network traffic based on security rules to determine what should be allowed and what should be denied.

## Hubs
A hub is a simple network device that connects multiple devices together. It works by flooding all data packets to all of the devices on the hub. This can make hubs inefficient and can cause network congestion. NICs can be connected to hubs, but hubs are not as efficient as switches and are not as commonly used today.

Network hubs are relatively inexpensive and easy to use, but they can be inefficient and can cause network congestion, especially in large networks. This is because all devices on the hub will receive all packets, even if they are not intended for them. This can lead to increased bandwidth usage and decreased network performance.

## Modems
Modems are devices that allow computers to connect to the internet. NICs can be connected to modems to allow computers to access the internet.

## Computers
Computers are also network devices. Computers can be connected directly to form a basic network using a crossover cable. This is not a common practice, but it can be useful for troubleshooting or for transferring data between two computers without using a switch or routers in a larger network.
